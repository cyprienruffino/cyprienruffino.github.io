We focus on conditioning through auxiliary tasks, that is we  explicitly implement additional objective to the generative model to complement the initial goal of learning the data distribution.First, we introduce generative modeling through several examples, and present the Generative Adversarial Networks framework.","tags":["Thesis"],"title":"PhD Thesis: Auxiliary Tasks for the Conditioning of Generative Adversarial Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyprien Ruffino","Romain Hérault","Eric Laloy","Gilles Gasso"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"0d6cd0620d547b7cec5a6f04518a09f1","permalink":"https://cyprienruffino.github.io/publication/neucom2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/neucom2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We address the task of learning effective generative adversarial networks when only very few pixel values are known beforehand.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Pixel-wise Conditioned Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Synthesis and Completion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric Laloy","Niklas Linde","Cyprien Ruffino","Romain Hérault","Gilles Gasso","Diederik Jacques"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"681f70ed6ca87273c575aa54c6b2ee96","permalink":"https://cyprienruffino.github.io/publication/compgeo2019/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/compgeo2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the use of GANs for gradient-based deterministic inversion in Geophysics and highlight the associated difficulties caused by the nonlinear GAN transform.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Gradient-based deterministic inversion of geophysical data with generative adversarial networks: Is it feasible?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyprien Ruffino","Romain Hérault","Eric Laloy","Gilles Gasso"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"de0fc93db0fab2efe3a8b1c45ffbae90","permalink":"https://cyprienruffino.github.io/publication/esann2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/esann2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate adding  a  regularization  term to  the  conditioning  of  GANs  to  deal  with  cases  where  a  small  subset  of the  image  is  known  beforehand.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Pixel-wise Conditioning of Generative Adversarial Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyprien Ruffino","Romain Hérault","Eric Laloy","Gilles Gasso"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"c0200cd908179bb6124b7664579b1c1c","permalink":"https://cyprienruffino.github.io/publication/cap2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cap2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We have presented an architecture for globally ergodic data generation.

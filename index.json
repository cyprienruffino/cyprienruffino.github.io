However, its robustness may be questioned because of the small size of the training datasets. Though the issue could be solved by data augmentation, polarization modalities are subject to physical feasibility constraints unaddressed by classical data augmentation techniques. To address this issue, we propose to use CycleGAN, an image translation technique based on deep generative models that solely relies on unpaired data, to transfer large labeled road scene datasets to the polarimetric domain. We design several auxiliary loss terms that, alongside the CycleGAN losses, deal with the physical constraints of polarimetric images. The efficiency of this solution is demonstrated on road scene object detection tasks where generated realistic polarimetric images allow to improve performances on cars and pedestrian detection up to 9%. The resulting constrained CycleGAN is publicly released, allowing anyone to generate their own polarimetric images.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Physically-admissible polarimetric data augmentation for road-scene analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cyprien Ruffino"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"bd1ff6683d7df9feb9244c9bae20b799","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/these/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/these/","section":"publication","summary":"In this thesis, we explore the conditioning of Generative Adversarial Networks, that is influencing the generation process in order to control the content of a generated image.
